Gscript code to accompany the article titled "USING THE GOOGLE SHEETS PLATFORM FOR INTERACTIVE SPREADSHEET ASSIGNMENTS"


Easy way: open the "Project File Manager" worksheet at the following link, and save a copy in your own Google account:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-cPZhTdXjqaAz1HCxp-u9DHmftMkdmd6pcIDMtkLM3A/edit?usp=sharing
Note that you will have to grant permission for the code to create and modify files in your account.  

Alternatively: if you wish to review the source code yourself, review and download the Gscript file "Code.gs", and paste it into the GScript editor yourself.  You will still have to grant permission for the code to run, but you will have the chance to review it first.
